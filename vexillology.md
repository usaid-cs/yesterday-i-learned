- [Princple of flag design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnv5iKB2hl4): keep it simple. A flag should be so simple that even a child can draw it from memory. Use a standard set of colours, red white blue... blablabla and black. **Never use words or lettering of any kind.** Draw your design on a one-inch canvas. If it doesn't fit, it's no good.

- Germany emphasises that its flag is red, black and [gold, not yellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Germany#Color), to symbolise the [Austrian empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire).

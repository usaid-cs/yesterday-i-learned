- 水浸眼眉自然浮.
- [Blocking one's right eye](https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-owls-right-eye/) became the symbol of resistance against China. Fascinating article.
- If "什" is used to mean "assorted" or "ten different things", then the pronunciation turns into shi2. Since that simplified character maps to 甚 as well, you can illicitly call it 甚錦 (what-sorted) or 甚菜 (what vegetables).
- The Chinese government believes it has no issues with human rights because [its definition of human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_China#Position_of_the_government) is different from that of [the universal one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights): that welfare of the collective should be put ahead of the rights of individuals, which makes it a-ok to oppress the minority if it benefits the majority. The oppressed don't necessarily agree, of course, and in a [single-party, authoritarian system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7dTDjRnBqU), you don't really have a say anyway.
- The song [心太软](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%BF%83%E5%A4%AA%E8%BD%AF/30530) was composed after the composer lost a bunch of money at a casino.
- The term ["腰斬"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist_chop) can refer to both the cancellation of a television program mid-series, or literally cutting someone in half at the waist, which was a form of punishment until Yongzheng abolished it.
- ["放生"](https://youtube.com/watch?v=oZWcDu940eI) refers to a technique whereby the Chinese government *allows* its citizens to view the most liberal western / Hong Kong news outlets, which are the most outspoken media with almost ridiculous points of view, to have them believe that "see? see how they are talking about us?".
- ["Made in Hong Kong"](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-54097386) stopped being a thing in 2020.
- Similar to how you don't know what Jesus looked like, you don't know how the [historical Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guan_Yu) really looked, either.
- ["入赘"](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%85%A5%E8%B5%98%E5%A9%9A%E5%A7%BB/1856700?fromtitle=%E5%85%A5%E8%B5%98&fromid=572296) (ru4 zhui4), also called 倒插门, is the practice of a man marrying into the woman's house, instead of the other way around. The woman's parents will be their children's "inner" grandparents, and the man's parents, outer. [Their children will also inherit the woman's surname](https://www.zhihu.com/question/280069174).
- "哀家" (ai1 jia1) is reserved for a widow. More specifically, an emperor's widow.
- Only people of Manchu ancestry can call themselves [奴才](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucai) ("slave"). Han Chinese are forbidden from using that term, using 臣 instead. "奴才意識" ("slave mentality") is best described by this Jackie Chan quote: ["I'm gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled. If we're not being controlled, we'll just do what we want."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM_oejSD0sY)
- Apparently ["Chinese Taipei"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Taipei) is deliberately ambiguous, because it doesn't say which China it is, making it more politically correct than "Taiwan" (if you support ROC) or "Taiwan, China" (if you support the PRC).
- A 中央空调男 is a guy who makes all the ladies warm and fuzzy inside (instead of just you).
- ["liang xi is the superior sleeping surface"](https://i.imgur.com/AtmqngP.png) - [/u/pixelschatten](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/645f7f/chinese_hard_beds_in_america/dfzr09r/)
- Genocide and [forced birth control](https://apnews.com/269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP) are A-OK if we label it as ["Vocational Education and Training Centers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps), where they can learn about the importance of national unity and social order, and perhaps to learn a skill or two while away from home. A Chinese person said the "up to 1.5 million" estimate cannot be true: "that's like locking up [an entire city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan). We don't have the space for that". The "Centers" are [quite nice inside](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/05/secret-footage-uighur-detention-merdan-ghappar-chinese-prison-xinjiang). No blood or filth or anything.
- That one guy who just had to [walk around with 100kg of rocks](http://www.chinanews.com/sh/2020/08-05/9257144.shtml)
- A "抄手", full name "麻辣抄手" is wontons floating in a full bowl of chili oil.

- Samsung actually [doesn't make any phones in China](https://www.sammobile.com/where-are-samsung-phones-made) (2019 onwards). All their Chinese factories closed down and went to other places, like Vietnam and Brazil.
- China implies that "50 years no change" means that the change is completed by 50 years. Hong Kong believes "50 years no change" means literally not changing for 50 years.
- On China's security law that criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism, and foreign interference, that ["could spell the end of Hong Kong's unique freedoms"](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52765838), (RTHK said that) China said: national security is not an SAR's area of administration.
- The [22 states that disapprove Xinjiang re-education camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps#International_reactions) are the ones that we often consider more developed than China (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada). The 50 states that support these camps are the ones we consider less developed (Algeria, Angola, Bahrain, Bangladesh).
- China has a lower [prison population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate) than America, both absolutely (1.7M vs 2.1M) and per capita (120 vs 665).
- [翟东升](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%BF%9F%E4%B8%9C%E5%8D%87/3523774), a "vice dean of international relations", [said that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bt63j3CNec) the "wall" that China built around its internet infrastructure was indeed a protectionist attempt to build local businesses without getting dominated by foreign companies.
- The [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China) ("主席") is the head of state, a ceremonial figurehead. The [Premier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China) ("国务院 总理") is the head of government. As a one-party state, the [General Secretary of the CCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China) ("总书记") holds ultimate power and authority over state and government: ["实际上总书记职务的地位要高于作为国家元首的国家主席，权力也较作为政府首脑的国务院总理大"](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%A7%E5%85%9A%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%AE%E5%A7%94%E5%91%98%E4%BC%9A%E6%80%BB%E4%B9%A6%E8%AE%B0), and quite often the president and the general secretary are the same person. The general secretary and premier just work together on the same things, as far as I can tell.
- Originally meaning "strengthening one's integrity alone", "独善其身" now basically means "it's every man for himself".
- There are multiple types of [Chinese people overseas](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B5%B7%E5%A4%96%E8%8F%AF%E4%BA%BA): 华侨, Chinese citizens who settled overseas; 华人, former Chinese citizens having obtained citizenship elsewhere; and 华裔, children of the other two types, born outside of China. Despite potentially having never been to China, 华裔 can have Chinese citizenship by parental association, making them also 华侨.
- China's ["IPv9"](http://www.circleid.com/posts/explaining_chinas_ipv9/) is actually just a DNS that maps something back onto IPv4/6. [The addresses are pure numbers](https://wiki.mbalib.com/wiki/%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%97%E5%9F%9F%E5%90%8D), so perhaps you can have your phone number and have the same number as your IPv9 address.
- Unfortunately, "bloodbath" translates to "bath blood" (浴血).
- The mother of the king is also called the [dowager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_dowager). 慈禧太后 was one.

For some reason the woman gets to keep all of that. The man always loses.

- [WireGuard is NOT known to be stealthy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/f67mb9/firefox_releases_android_app_for_its_vpn_service/fi3fk0a/). It is not designed to bypass the great firewall.

- [Some "China Highlights" website](https://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/chinese-food/spring-rolls.htm) claims that spring rolls were not rolled up (as "春盘", i.e. served as vegetables on dough) until some time in the Ming dynasty (1368 to 1644).
- Poor people up in northern China just [fry up potato, green pepper and eggplant](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%9C%B0%E4%B8%89%E9%B2%9C/32207) and call it a meal. When they feel like being special, they add *red* peppers.
- The [18-digit Chinese ID card number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCuJapNoZM) contains information as follows: (1 ~ 6) location, (7 ~ 10) year, (11 ~ 12) month, (13 ~ 14) day, (15 ~ 17) auto-increment number, because more than one person is born at a location every day (plus even/odd, where even is female and odd is male). The last(18) digit is the check digit, which can be `[0-9X]`.
- A Chinese guinea pig is called a "Dutch pig".
- At least part of why the Chinese are so competitive is the saying 成者為王，敗者為寇 ("the winner becomes king, the loser becomes outlaw"), in line with the [mandate of heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_Heaven), that you must win to possess power.

- China builds so many high speed trains because they have the political will to. China built a money-losing high-speed railway into Xinjiang to [promote ethnic unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JDoll8OEFE), i.e. bring the place closer to Beijing so the region can be controlled. They did the exact same thing with Hong Kong, except at least it makes financial sense. Some Hong Kong people don't like it because there is now a spot inside the Hong Kong station that is part of China, violating the autonomy promised by the Basic Law.

- China's internet has so few Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) that [Oracle said it is more like a giant Intranet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/oracle-chinas-internet-is-designed-more-like-an-intranet/). While traffic in other countries can traval through different countries if it is faster, traffic between Chinese client-servers never leaves China.
- The Chinese claim to be able to identify whether someone is potentially a criminal by [looking at their faces](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602955/neural-network-learns-to-identify-criminals-by-their-faces/), raising concerns for successful, law-abiding citizens that are just ugly.
- [神韵 is a Falun Gong thing](https://www.scpr.org/news/2018/04/27/82543/shen-yun-chinese-falun-gong/). It even says 法輪大法好 right in the play.

- [The Chinese social credit system](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4) prevents people with low scores to: book flights/trains, get fast Internet, get your kids into the best schools, get the best jobs, book the best hotels, and so on. There is no numeric "score" yet, though, just a blacklist.
- The same place where 普洱 tea came from is also [China's tin capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gejiu).

- China's [social credit system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System) is something like [Nosedive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive#Comparisons_to_Social_Credit_System), an episode of Black Mirror, except the citizens like it, and it's more like your equifax / transunion score, where your government runs one.
- Being gay is decriminalised in China [since 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_China), and declassified as a mental illness in 2001. Still a lot of stigma though.

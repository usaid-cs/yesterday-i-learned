- Acquisition is one of the things most CEOs delay until it is too late.
- Your options (if any) is worth nothing until exercised, making them tax-free.
- Your options cannot be sold back to the company. That is, unless someone else wants to buy your options, they are also worth nothing.
- Your options are immediately vested ('yours', or eqv.) at no cost if the company gets acquired.
- Vesting means you earned some options. It doesn't mean you exercised them. When you exercise them, you have the option to buy stocks, which, [if the price you pay is different from the stock's fair market value (which it always is, because that's why you earn preferantial options in the first place) you pay a tax on that](http://blog.modernadvisor.ca/employee-stock-options-maximize-financial-gain/).
- [The four stages of company development](http://takeaswig.com/the-end-of-the-facebook-era): Emergence (when it started), Coalescence (when it becomes large enough that people can't ignore it), Bureaucratization (when it becomes a formal giant), and Decline (when it stops being useful)
- **Speculating**: buying a company's stocks when the company isn't making a profit.
- Look at a company's political climate in addition to what the company's competition is doing.

- Do remember that [technical debt](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10925141) _is_ debt; the time you borrow to make a feature must be paid back _soon_, and not _eventually_.
- The less money a startup has left, [the less likely it will receive more](http://paulgraham.com/pinch.html).
- Know what you are saving for. You can be saving for a house. You can be saving for a car. You can be saving for retirement. [Know your net worth, identify your goal, and work backwards.](https://www.businessinsider.com/first-step-early-retirement-planning-take-inventory)
- After a layoff, you should withdraw money from RRSP [only after you finish using your severance payments and EI](https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/retirement/rrsps-are-about-much-more-than-just-retirement), and when you have no income at all, where you are in the bottom tax bracket.
- In an economy where people run the risk of defaulting (which is not a "credit crunch", that's a different thing entirely), [companies that issue credit cards](https://www.mastercard.ca/en-ca/search-by-bank.html), like Scotiabank and Canadian Tire, do not do well.
- [The stock market is not a gauge for how well the economy is doing](https://theweek.com/articles/886198/booming-stock-market-shows-america-diseased); it is just an indicator for how well *companies* are doing, and, therefore, how quickly money is being funnelled---from [the government, ironically socialised](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/ej4qov/the_booming_stock_market_shows_america_is_diseased/fcvhph0/)---to the rich.
- Furloughs are forced unpaid leaves, sometimes regular (like during periods of time when no business is expected). The position remains guaranteed for the employee to return to.
- A Convertible note is a loan (debt), not some grant. At the end of a [convertible note's maturity date](https://www.indinero.com/blog/safe-convertible-notes-comparison), the founder must either pay back the loan plus interest, or convert the note into equity.
- [SAFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_agreement_for_future_equity) (simple agreement for future equity)
- There's a guide to [how much stock you give your employees at what size of the company](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation/sections/typical-employee-equity-levels).
- "Common shares" are basically useless when "preferred shares" exist. Preferred shares are always sold first. If [the company ends up with $0 after the sale of those shares](https://marker.medium.com/my-company-sold-for-100-million-and-i-got-zilch-how-can-that-be-f7be0563f1f8), you, a proud owner of a billion common shares, end up with nothing as well.

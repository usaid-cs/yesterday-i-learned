- Timeshares are complex: each owner wants to make their own decisions. [You don't want that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnltGCBLo4Q&feature=youtu.be). You also don't want to going to the same place every year for the rest of your life. Timeshares are also properties that don't generate income... and hard to sell.

So you will have to figure out how to get this 2.4M in 20 years. 2.4M in 20 years is (interestingly enough) back to 120k per year. So unless you save 10k every month now, you aren't retiring.

- *"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet.

- > One of [these spiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaurobius_ferox) [that let their kids eat them] is Stegodyphus lineatus, found in the Mediterranean and Middle East. Once a female's 80 or so eggs hatch, she stops tending her web and eating, and devotes all her time to feeding her newborns. She pukes up a fluid made from what's left of her last few meals and some of her own guts, which started breaking down while she guarded the eggs and built up as liquefied tissue in her abdomen. As the days go on and the spiderlings eat, mom's innards continue to liquefy, and more of her guts and other organs like the ovaries dissolve as they become expendable. A little less than half of her body mass gets turned into food like this. After two weeks, mom has fed the children what she can and the well runs dry. The spiderlings then pierce her abdomen with their mouthparts and drain her of the rest of her body fluids. They'll spend another two weeks at the nest with mom's empty exoskeleton before going their own way.

- Eggs can increase cardiovascular risk, not largely because of the cholesterol content, but largely because eggs contain a lot of lecithin, which is converted to ["TMAO"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimethylamine_N-oxide) by gut bacteria, which, in turn, alters cholesterol metabolism, increasing cholesterol deposition along blood vessel walls. Counter this with vegetarian food, which changes the gut flora composition slightly.

- (Soluble) fibres lower cholesterol via Le Chatelier's Principle: *When fiber interferes with absorption of bile in the intestines, the bile is excreted in the feces. To make up for this loss of bile, the liver makes more bile salts. The body uses cholesterol to make bile salts. So in order to obtain the cholesterol necessary to make more bile salts, the liver increases its production of LDL receptors. These receptors are responsible for pulling cholesterol out of LDL molecules in the bloodstream. Therefore, the more bile salts are made from the liver, the more LDL cholesterol is pulled from the blood.*

Males are approximately 7.5–15 mm (0.3–0.6 in) long and 3–7 mm (0.12–0.28 in) wide. The parasite severs the blood vessels in the fish's tongue, causing the tongue to fall off.

- After the caterpillar becomes a butterfly, the [toxin Cardenolide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardenolide) shifts to different parts of the body. Since many birds attack the wings of the butterfly, having three times the cardiac glycosides in the wings leaves predators with a very foul taste and may prevent them from ever ingesting the body of the butterfly. **WITH THAT SAID** In order to combat predators that remove the wings only to ingest the abdomen, [monarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly) keep the most potent cardiac glycosides in their abdomens.

- Fish don't freeze in salt water, despite being less salty than salt water, because animal glycoproteins inhibit ice crystal growth. [Exact mechanism is explained here](https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/blog/why-dont-fish-freeze-to-death-in-icy-water/): "flat crystal faces with high growth rates were truncated by faces with slower growth rates, causing the polyhedral crystal to be surrounded by only flat faces with the lowest growth rates. This resulted in greatly slowing down the growth of the ice crystals."

So, unless you have a reason, "try to walk on your balls".

- The reason you wake up at the middle of the night after heavy drinking: alcohol does not turn into any kind of sugar. In fact, alcohol tends to induce a hypoglycemic state, which is hypothesized to be one of the reasons that drinking on an empty stomach tends to make you more inebriated--a lot of the signs of low blood sugar mimic alcohol intoxication. This is because when alcohol is metabolized, it passes off some of its chemical energy to a compound called NAD, reducing it to NADH, which the cell uses for metabolic purposes. However, when alcohol floods the liver with NADH, the relative amount of NAD available is fairly low, and this molecule is required for several of the reactions of gluconeogenesis, which is the process by which the liver creates glucose in between meals. Hence, alcohol on an empty stomach can cause low blood glucose by inhibiting the livers ability to perform gluconeogenesis. It also never acts as a "stimulant" in any way. It is eventually metabolized to acetic acid, which is not a stimulant.

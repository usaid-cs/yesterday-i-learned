- Not everyone gets charged with manslaughter because [manslaughter requires the intent to cause harm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter#Canadian_law) (just not death).
- Earning more than 10% outside Canada [removes your ability to pay nothing for income tax under ~$12,000](https://www.taxback.com/blog/declaring-foreign-income-in-canada), so if you... earned $10800 in Canada and $1201 internationally, you just landed yourself more work than it was worth.
- [80,000 Canadians die from cancer every year](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310039401). The coronavirus is around the 6th killer of the year at the time of writing.

- Jean Chrétien is one of the 24 people who have received the [Order of Merit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Merit). The Queen said [it had to do with the relationship between her and his wife Aline](https://www.ctvnews.ca/chretien-says-order-of-merit-humbling-experience-1.416725)... and they meet together and speak perfect French.
- "Nigger Rapids", a place in by the Gatineau River where a black couple once drowned, [was renamed for obvious reasons](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/11-quebec-sites-that-contain-the-n-word-to-be-renamed-1.3245106) in 2015. According to that same post, there were six places in Quebec with the exact word *Nigger* in it, despite the province's place names are predominantly French (for which there were five *nègre*s). Therefore... French Quebecois were less racist than English Quebecois? Not sure.
- The [Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms) allows for free speech "under reasonable limits", where hate speech, obscenity, and defamation are restricted. Legal right to free speech may also apply only [between a government and a private entity](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23679515), not between two private entities. The government cannot interfere with your free speech... a company can interfere with free speech.
- The referral process to see a health specialist must be started by either a family doctor, a nurse, or a walk-in clinic. That referral allows the specialist to bill OHIP at the consult rate.

Black Canadians continue facing discrimination while the rest of the (white) country pretends black and native American slavery never happened here.

- There are [many reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/gvsphi/buying_a_house_should_i_transfer_savings_to_rrsp/fsqpfc1/) RRSP is preferred over TFSA. But in short, there is almost no reason RRSP is preferred over TFSA.
- Child support ends when the child is 22 years old (if you get married) or 18 years old (common law).
- [It is illegal to be naked in public, or in private but where the public can see you](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/public-nudity-laws-upheld-by-ontario-court-1.1201320), but at the same time, [the law is rarely enforced](https://globalnews.ca/news/5281720/toplessness-public-nudity-legal/), e.g. people go naked in the pride parade all the time.

- Canada's government style can be summarised as: [no accountability](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/gnxb2l/canada_waited_too_long_to_close_borders_tam/).
- The social safety net, namely EI, is [supposed](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/g6rrnf/anyone_worried_about_a_great_depression_20/) to save the economy unlike the 1930s, when safety nets did not exist.
- As long as you are 12 year old or older, [you can legally consent to sex with someone your age](https://owjn.org/2016/08/canadian-law-and-youth-age-of-consent-to-sexual-activity/), and as long as you are a legal adult, you can legally have sex with anyone aged 16 and up who consents.

- Sometimes you [cannot file for bankruptcy](https://www.mymoneycoach.ca/blog/cant-file-for-bankruptcy-canada-need-alternatives.html). Reasons include: if you earn too much (I don't know, somehow), have loans that can't be paid off by bankruptcy (like student loans), or have a job that prevents you from working if you have once declared bankrupt. You will also never be able to get that job back for obvious reasons.
- [Spousal RRSP uses *your* deduction limit](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/contributing-a-rrsp-prpp/contributing-your-spouse-s-common-law-partner-s-rrsps.html) to contribute to another person's account.

- A "snowbird" is a boomer who migrates to Florida every winter.
- If you die with an RRSP balance, you ["receive" all of it just before death](https://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/what-happens-to-rrsp-when-someone-dies/) and becomes your taxable income, but if you have a spouse, then special rules can apply to defer some of the taxes. I haven't read it.

- Canada's defence minister Harjit Sajjan [invented his own gas masks for Sikhs](https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/05/canadas-new-defense-minister-made-his-own-gas-mask-to-work-with-his-sikh-beard/) so he could fight.

- [Line of credit / lines of credit have "draw periods"](https://www.creditkarma.com/advice/i/what-is-line-of-credit/), or the period during which you may take out money. It can last a few years. After those few years, you have a few more years to pay back the money. Sometimes a line of credit account can have a monthly fee to keep open. [Interest rate on a line of credit can change on you](https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/loans/loans-lines-credit.html), so don't borrow unless you can pay back.

- [**Withholding tax**](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/learn/rrsp-withholding-tax#how_much_is_the_rrsp_withholding_tax_rate): in addition to the income tax bracket, taking money out of RRSP will be taxed further (10~20%) depending on how much you take out before retirement. **You also don't get your contribution room back after withdrawal**. So think twice before taking money out, or putting in money that you need.
- Old Ontario car plates (1970s) have ["keep it beautiful"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Ontario#1973_to_present) on it instead of "yours to discover". *Real* old plates (1910s) have just the year of manufacture.

On average, each Canadian loses $0.63 per year in romance scams.
- You can return a cell phone within 15 days of purchase because [CRTC said so](https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/phone/mobile/code.htm). You can technically also use half a month worth of data and return the plan that probably comes with the device. So... hypothetically you can root a device and then give it back if it fails. Best Buy says a restocking fee applies, but hey... [CRTC says Bell doesn't charge it](https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2015/lt150507b.htm).
- [Old age security requires you to have been in Canada for 10 years or more.](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada/plan-finances/senior-benefits.html) Guranteed Income Supplement (GIS) requires you to be receiving OAS in the first place.

- [Winnipeg has the highest parking fines in the country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB24lj71VPA). Legal traps. Signs that say you can park there, but you practically can't because of a fire hydrant or a "crosswalk" or something. **Cash grab**. Private parking tickets are bullshit and not legally enforceable.

- Housing bubbles pop if [people cannot afford housing](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/housing_bubble.asp), which can be caused by an economic downturn, a rise of interest rates resulting from an economic boom, or if no one wants houses anymore. If [the first is directly linked to the second](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/eilc1j/canada_back_in_worlds_top_10_economies_with_room/fcs2291/), i.e. the economy is driven by low interest rates, there is no way out for this bubble.

[Canada Pension Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Pension_Plan) (CPP) is funded by you... but [you only need to make one contribution to CPP to collect every single pension after that](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-benefit/eligibility.html). So work at least once before you turn 65.
- If no one can have sex in public, and homeless people don't have homes, then it is already illegal for the poor to reproduce (if everyone were perfectly lawful, anyway).

- "Quebecers" are a [nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation) because [a bill in 2006 said so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_nation_motion). This "nation" is not a country but a collection of people, like in "first nations". In Chinese, this translates to either [民族 (ethnic/ethnographic group), 國族 (actually "nation"), 族群 (ethnic group), or 人種 (race)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B0%91%E6%97%8F_%28%E6%B6%88%E6%AD%A7%E7%BE%A9%29).

- [Canadians cannot do a "credit freeze"](https://globalnews.ca/news/5706918/capital-one-breach-new-social-insurance-number-sin/). The concept is American-only. Replacing your SIN does not erase your old one, and any debt incurred by the old one is still going to be paid by you, so getting a new SIN is not useful for fraud protection, and is [not entertained by the government](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/sin/protect.html) unless the SIN has _already_ been used for fraud.
- [Canola oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canola_oil#Origin) came from CAN- (Canada) and -OLA (suffix for other oil products). It is a variant of rapeseed oil, so not all rapeseed oil is canola oil, but all canola oil is rapeseed oil.

- In Canada, [you can](https://www.todaysparent.com/family/family-life/myths-about-getting-a-divorce/): cheat and still win a court case, get divorced without signing (with due process), split assets with your gay partner, and move out of the house and still keep it after the divorce.

- On [women poking holes in condoms](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13511/index.do) to get themselves pregnant, the supreme court says: it is sexual assault (since it invalidates the partner's consent) but not fraud (since unwanted fatherhood is not serious bodily harm to the man).

- [King George V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V) said that [the Canada flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Canada)'s red and white colours were to come from [Saint George's Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George%27s_Cross), and the French royal emblem, respectively. However, the red on the Saint George's Cross is rgb(207, 8, 31); the red on the [Union Jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Jack), which _has_ the Saint George's Cross in it, is rgb(200, 16, 46); both of which are different from Canada's rgb(255, 0, 0), so Canada didn't actually get the red from Saint George's Cross. There was actually no record of [Saint George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George), a dude born in [present-day Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia), personally using his cross, but the people of [Genoa, Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa) made that flag and attributed the design to him, so... it's his flag now.

- When the region of Waterloo says [we'll help pay 5% of your house](https://www.reddit.com/r/waterloo/comments/b5iooh/has_anyone_used_the_region_of_waterloo_affordable/), they mean they want to have 5% stake in your house. It can be a good thing (if you're poor and just want a place to live) or a bad thing (if you're rich and want to be richer), so this is a very good system.
- VRTUCAR is owned by [Communauto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communauto), a private company headquartered in Montreal. [It is not a co-op](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/vrtucar-communauto-community-careshare-kw-waterloo-hamilton-1.4594729).

- On why selling sex is legal but buying sex is not: so the marginalised (the prostitutes) don't risk going to jail by making a living. "Basically, more people are willing to buy sex legally than are willing to sell it. A LOT more. So when prostitution is legalized the demand shoots way up but the supply does not. This makes sex trafficking and forced prostitution very profitable. If you look at crime stats for human trafficking before and after prostitution is legalized, human trafficking actually goes up by a lot in countries where prostitution has been legalized. Legalizing selling sex while keeping it illegal to buy solves both problems. It doesn't increase demand, and it makes prostitution safer for everyone involved." - /u/The_Last_Mammoth

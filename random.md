- During a trade war (in this case, US vs China), the net exporter facing stiff tariffs (in this case, China) can lower its currency exhcange rate as a countermeasure. Lowered exchange rates make goods cheaper to buyers overall.
- To sharpen a knife, [kit doesn't matter, angle doesn't matter (that much), don't "thin" your knife, and you don't need to flatten your stone if you use one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB4anJ-Qm6E). Just hone the knife once every few meals, and sharpen your knife with any sharpener---not necessarily whetstones---as long as you are willing to try.
- The [Brubacher Edge Sharpness Scale](https://hubpages.com/education/So-Whats-the-BESS-Brubacher-Edge-Sharpness-Scale) (BESS) [numerically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcFvarfMKM) assesses how sharp your knife is. It is related to pressure (i.e. area of the edge). To test it, you cut a strand of filament on top of a scale. The amount of force (but in grams) you can exert on the filament before it breaks (i.e. the BESS) is larger for dull knives, and smaller for sharp knives.
- [Bookkeepers work under accountants](https://www.skillsacademy.co.za/senior-bookkeeper/), and, in general, the finance department. *Senior* bookkeepers can also work on payroll. Accountants [plan out what bookkeepers will record](http://www.stasuik.com/what-is-the-difference-between-an-accountant-and-a-bookkeeper/), as well as manage the process used to monitor business activities. So, in a way, bookkeepers are accountants that didn't do CPA.

- When it comes to sealing letters, [the type of wax you use makes a difference](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/cx7e1l/guide_to_sealing_wax_etiquette/). Red seals mean formal business (the usual kind), black wax is for death and other types of mourning, green is for casual stuff, pink is for congratulations, white is for wedding invitations, and blue means romance and passion. Sealing wax is not wax. [It is shellac](https://youtu.be/xxb-XqsgaqM).
- Turns out you can never ask others [how to be a good wife/mother/daughter in law](https://www.zhihu.com/question/343092533). It's not possible to get a straight answer, even if you were a woman. Everyone says you are holding yourself hostage. No one will tell you how to be a good anything. You just have to guess. Anyway, the answer to being a good husband is: "有钱，足以养活老婆一家的，让他们全在家歇着，你一个人养活他们，家务全包，孩子自己带，还不说一句怨言。女人都想要这样的。"

- On ["token auth" vs "JWT token auth"](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40495728/1558430), it just seems to be that JWT tokens have automatic expiry dates. This causes JWT auths to end up having session-like characteristics.
- If a HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header is sent to your client, it will refuse to re-connect to your server with insecure (i.e. HTTP) connections for however many seconds you specify. [HSTS will only apply to the subdomain that applied it](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/112564), as well as the domains that are subdomain to it, but not its parents.
- Sending a `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` header [magically](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/middleware/#x-xss-protection-1-mode-block) stops a page from loading if the client finds the same contents on the page.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) has its own RFC, 7519. Each JWT is a three-part URL-safe string, in the form `(header).(payload).(signature)`. You send this thing in the `Authorization` header, like: `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGci...<snip>...yu5CSpyHI`. The point of JWT is that [it is stateless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token), so if your thing uses sessions, don't use JWT.
- JWT is [mostly](https://jwt.io/introduction/) for the server to verify that the user is who they say they are. Anyone can make a request to the server. But if the server generates a public key for a specific user, then only that particular user, who received the public key, can authenticate again as that user.
- Wikipedia seems to imply that Hong Kong's water is [bought](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E4%BE%9B%E6%B0%B4) from China; [a video on Weibo](https://m.weibo.cn/status/4408978802721694) seems to imply that the water is provided for free (because he mentioned that the construction is 100% paid for by China and suggests the water is also a gift). Water's price [doubled between 2007 and 2016](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E4%BE%9B%E6%B0%B4#%E5%83%B9%E6%A0%BC%E7%88%AD%E8%AD%B0), so while free construction is a nice gesture, the water is definitely not free.

Other [da vinci-esque interpretations](https://twitter.com/gracehw/status/1162222858757529603) indicate he wanted China to let Hong Kong rule itself.
- Unsanitised window navigation calls (like `?next=foo`) can be exploited to make the user run arbitrary JavaScript. If the code says `window.location.href = foo`, and `foo` is `javascript: alert()`, you just dun goof'd. That `foo` can be something much worse.
- According to "lost all hope", whose author tried to end himself and lived to tell everyone to think twice, [tighter emission controls today means it is no longer practical to kill yourself with a running car in the garage today](http://lostallhope.com/suicide-methods/carbon-monoxide-co-poisoning). By [lethality](http://lostallhope.com/suicide-methods/statistics-most-lethal-methods), shotgun to the head kills 99% of the time, while jumping from a tall place is the only "no tools required" method that still has a 90%+ kill rate (if you count a train as a tool).

- VLC's "compressor", actually [dynamic range compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression), works by reducing the max volume and min volume of some audio, reducing its dynamic range. Since "louder music sounds better", the availability of dynamic range compressors led to [loudness war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war), where everyone uses automatic dynamic range compression without clipping.
- Bankruptcy is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. [There are consequences](https://www.hoyes.com/blog/5-reasons-not-to-file-bankruptcy/). First of all, all your assets [except stuff like clothes and tools](https://www.hoyes.com/personal-bankruptcy/effects-of-claiming-bankruptcy/) must be sold to clear your existing debts. Second, if you earn more than what you should for 9~36 months after bankruptcy, that income goes to pay the debt. Third, this stays on your credit file for 14 years.

Since they're not spending it into the economy, it somewhat prolongs recessions/depressions](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/cmbgis/eli5_what_does_it_mean_when_a_country_like_china/ew1ol1x/).

- On why phones are getting [a 48MP camera sensor with binning, instead of a 12MP one with 4x larger pixels](https://www.gsmarena.com/quad_bayer_sensors_explained-news-37459.php): recovering more information from noise, and faster HDR. "If one of the four pixels on a Quad Bayer sensor captures noise ... that's only 25% of the information lost ..." "Alternatively, the sensor can be split up into two logical sensors -- one that captures a short exposure and one a long exposure (... HDR ...)"

- IP ratings apply to fresh water only. In other words, your everyday smartphone has zero resistance against corrosive seawater.
- On web frameworks, and "choosing the right framework": [*Once upon a time, we were focused on the important things - problem-solving, domain data, and business logic. But now we're almost entirely focused on abstraction, generics, and boilerplate while the important objective-related stuff that pays the bills just gets whatever scraps of time are leftover (if any).*](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16725492)
- ["Code rot resistance"](https://blog.heroku.com/the_new_heroku_4_erosion_resistance_explicit_contracts) is having your code specify the environment in which it wants to run, where the environment is what rots your code, *and* having the code specify what it does. Examples include: dependency locks like `package-lock.json` and `Gemfile`, and binding only to the ports that it declares to need.

- To handle (Gmail) emails you never plan to read, search for `older_than:3m in:unread` and mark them all as read / archive them.
- Nazis don't call themselves Nazis. Even Hitler didn't call himself a Nazi, because "Nazi" was a hypocorism of *Ignatz*, which can also mean a farmer, peasant, awkward and clumsy person, but Joseph Goebbel *did* call themselves "Der Nazi-Sozi".

- It turns out "Arbys", while [it is true that came from "RB"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arby%27s), the RB stands for "Raffel Brothers" rather than "roast beef". (The founders were the Forrest and Leroy Raffel)
- The project manager turns the product manager's vision of the product (which may be one or more projects) into bite-sized tasks that belongs to their project. Products may be internal or external.
- [GraphQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL). A thing [between a database and an API](https://medium.com/open-graphql/building-a-graphql-api-by-example-restaurant-reviews-acd80d60ec77). The major selling point is the client defines the structure of the data that the server returns, so it always gets what it wants. The major disadvantage is, well, if the client can make calls like that, then the server can't cache these results efficiently.
- On using assertions on production: ["(A good) approach is to leave the assertions in the code when you ship, and to automatically file a bug report on behalf of the end user and perhaps to try to re-start the application every time an assertion fails. At that same startup I mentioned above I had a boss who insisted that we not do this. I pointed out to him that an assertion failure meant that something in the program was very wrong and that it was likely that the program would produce the wrong result. ... *He said it was more important that the company avoid the appearance of having done something wrong than that we stop before producing an incorrect result.* I left the company."](https://rbcs-us.com/documents/Why-Most-Unit-Testing-is-Waste.pdf) Takeaway: write assertions when assertions will do, and unit tests when assertions will not.
- ["Despite being called the god of thunder, it is electricity that Thor controls"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovNJpzbAXK8)
- Build your software with three kinds of user interfaces. One, with the fewest buttons, to end users. Another one, with all buttons, for you (the developer). Finally, the one for operations and administrators that aren't you: NSA, the Russian government, whatever, to make sure they can do their jobs.
- "[If you want to reduce your test mass, the number one thing you should do is look at the tests that have never failed in a year (and the code hasn't been touched in the same year) and consider throwing them away.](https://rbcs-us.com/documents/Why-Most-Unit-Testing-is-Waste.pdf) They are producing no information for you — or at least very little information. The value of the information they produce may not be worth the expense of maintaining and running the tests. This is the first set of tests to throw away — whether they are unit tests, integration tests, or system tests."
- Betty Crocker is not a real person. Betty Crocker was the General Mills marketing department.
- The 及第 in [及第粥](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E5%8F%8A%E7%AC%AC%E7%B2%A5) came from 雜底 rather than [進士及第](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%BF%9B%E5%A3%AB%E5%8F%8A%E7%AC%AC). 進士 meant you're among the top 3 *classes* (一、二、三甲) in the central government entrance exam, 及第 meant you were selected, and 進士及第 meant you were one of the three people *among* 一甲 who was selected. As an aside, 進士出身 means you were in 二甲, 同進士出身 means you were in 三甲, and the name of the congee has almost nothing to do with the examination system.
- [TVs prioritise size over refresh rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXewr2IIz_M). TVs might also come with local dimming so they have "more contrast".
- The [decorator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) is not the same as how decorators are implemented in python. The decorator pattern is essentially a way to add functionality to just one instance of a class, without affecting the class itself.

- Submarines can't use GPS... submarines use sonar. But sonar tells enemies their location. So they just guess with inertia. Submarines also can't get internet... so they use VLF radio instead, where they can receive limited information at 700 words per minute.
- [Half of all large ships are registered in panama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7CvEt51fz4), because taxation is so low. An international ship follows the laws of its country, as long as it is outside any other country's territorial waters (12 miles from the coast).
- A [philosophical razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor) is called that because it "shaves off" unlikely explanations for something. [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) says simpler solutions are more likely to be correct than complex ones, [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) says someone doing bad things to you is probably being stupid instead of being mean, and [Newton's flaming laser sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Alder#Newton's_flaming_laser_sword) says that, if an argument cannot be settled by experiment or observation, then it is not worthy arguing about.

- [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox). Increasing efficiency in anything (like cars with better fuel economy) somehow increases overall usage (like, more people driving because it's efficient). To reduce overall environmental impact, simply increasing efficiency does not work, "however, governments and environmentalists generally assume that efficiency gains will lower resource consumption, ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising".

- [HTTP has 30+ registered method names](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods/http-methods.xhtml), most of which being WebDAV exclusives.

- A metric [carat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carat_%28mass%29) is exactly 200mg. Before 1907, a carat ranges from 187 to 216mg, depending on which country you ask.
- The FSF once unironically pointed out that [dating is a free software issue](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/dating-is-a-free-software-issue), citing "Many restaurants run reservations entirely through Web sites, using software and JavaScript that is proprietary".
- Japan has a special term called [成田離婚](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%88%90%E7%94%B0%E9%9B%A2%E5%A9%9A), describing newlyweds who fly out of the country through 成田国际机场 for their honeymoons, but realise how crappy their spouses are _during_ the honeymoon, divorcing right after they return.

- When buying tea, [full leaf is obviously the best choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_VsxGdECYI). Tiny chunks they collect afterwards are sold in tea bags, but it doesn't mean it's bad, it just means the flavour comes out quicker because the surface area is greater, and the flavour is not as nuanced.
- Both the [White House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW6hxlThB_o) and the [Buckingham Palace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOFMqBxJPAA) have a room with "China" in its name (China room / China luncheon room).

- [Only racers near the back get blue shells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFfga8-3SZI). The blue shell is a homing missile that aims for the racer in the first place. It is therefore an equaliser (for casual players) that makes sure everyone is relatively close together. Its blast radius is designed to hit many players near the first racer. If you can't avoid the blue shell, the best thing you can do is to brake and hope the blast radius also hits the racer in second place.
- Companies want to [turn their brands into household names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_awareness), but not so much that it turns into the product category itself. See: [Nintendo calling their products "videogame consoles" to make sure "Nintendo" is not what they're making](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ah9wsh/til_nintendo_pushed_the_term_videogame_console_so/), and [Velcro calling their things "hook and loops"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRi8LptvFZY) so "Velcro" remains the name for the real deal.
- The [500 rule of astrophotography](https://petapixel.com/2015/01/06/avoid-star-trails-following-500-rule/) (i.e. taking photos of stars): if you keep your shutter open for too long, stars will start to trail and look bad. Use _500 Divided By the Focal Length of Your Lens (in mm) = The Longest Exposure (in Seconds) Before Stars Start to “Trail”_. If you have a 24mm lens, then 500/24 says you can only open your shutter for 20 seconds. Note: [focal length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length) is not the [focal point/distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_%28optics%29), which can be infinity.

- China builds so many high speed trains because they have the political will to. China built a money-losing high-speed railway into Xinjiang to [promote ethnic unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JDoll8OEFE), i.e. bring the place closer to Beijing so the region can be controlled. They did the exact same thing with Hong Kong, except at least it makes financial sense. Some Hong Kong people don't like it because there is now a spot inside the Hong Kong station that is part of China, violating the autonomy promised by the Basic Law.
- According to the anime, shellder changes shape [when the snowpoke wants to evolve](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:Slowking_evolution_anime.png).
- SSDs with [quad level cells](https://www.anandtech.com/show/13752/anandtech-year-in-review-2018-ssds) now exist.

- No one ever said proposals need to be a surprise. The moment you start asking for ring sizes, she would have already known something's up.
- [One-way plane tickets more expensive than return tickets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72hlr-E7KA0): flight companies want to price their trips as competitive as possible (assuming competition exists). So they make price brackets to lower some ticket prices, and raise some others to make up for the lower fares. They raise prices business travellers, who can pay more, to offset the cheaper tickets sold to holiday goers, who pay for their own tickets and are more budget-conscious. They use "price discrimination", aka pricing rules, to make sure "business-like" trips are charged more. Business trips don't have a "minimum stay" period, because business people travel for just a few days and return. When they do that, they also introduce a problematic case where they can't calculate how long your stay is when you book one-way... so it's just half the price of a business-like return trip, rather than the price of a holiday-like trip.
- When someone asks you "how much do we need to scale?", you need an answer based on two things you need to know: the number of additional users, and % extra load per user.

- You're supposed to use a stack for checking whether a bunch of brackets match up with each other correctly. Alternatively, if you are skilled, prove that a `count('[') == count(']')` check is sufficient if the string starts with `[` and ends with `]`.
- [The Chinese social credit system](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4) prevents people with low scores to: book flights/trains, get fast Internet, get your kids into the best schools, get the best jobs, book the best hotels, and so on. There is no numeric "score" yet, though, just a blacklist.
- Summing up [modern web development](https://www.sonniesedge.co.uk/talks/dear-developer): JS being required by default means it is overused, and used for the wrong things. "Yes, it's technically amazing to ... have your JS build a content page, but it's utterly over-engineered and impractical for most occasions (where HTML should be served as HTML)." Requiring JS to serve a page means the robustness goes missing, since users can disable JS. Also: developers make pages like everyone has unlimited fast Internet.

- [Date formatting using `yyyy` vs `YYYY`](https://ericasadun.com/2018/12/25/iso-8601-yyyy-yyyy-and-why-your-year-may-be-wrong/): "`yyyy` specifies the calendar year whereas `YYYY` specifies the year (of “Week of Year”), used in the ISO year-week calendar."

They often work independently because they have a proven track record of delivering the goods. They are expected to mentor Junior and intermediate developers. Often they are amazing troubleshooters. They have run into those same problems before and have a very good idea of where to look first. Seniors often mentor outside the workplace as well. They generally have at least ten years of experience and have almost always been on at least one death march and know exactly why some things are to be avoided. They know how to deliver a working product and meet a deadline. They know what corners can be cut and what corners should never be cut. They know at least one and often several languages at the expert level. They have seen a lot of "hot new technologies" hit the workplace and disappear, so they tend to be a bit more conservative about jumping on the bandwagon for the next exciting new development tool (but not completely resistant to change - those would be the older Intermediate developers who never make the leap to Senior). They understand their job is to deliver working software that does what the users want, not to play with fun tools. They are often pickier about where they will work because they can be and because they have seen first hand how bad some places can be. They seek out the places that have the most interesting tasks to do. Often they know more about their company's products than anyone else even if they have been there only a few months. They know they need more than programming knowledge and are good at getting knowledge about the business domain they support as well. They are often aware of issues that juniors never consider and intermediates often don't think about such as regulatory and legal issues in the business domain they support. They can and will push back a requirement because they know what the problems with it will be and can explain the same to the laymen." - HLGEM](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/14972/116811)

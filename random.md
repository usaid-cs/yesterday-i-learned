- GFCIs detect current leakage by comparing the magnetic field strength between line in and line out. In an AC situation, in and out should always be equal. A two-outlet GFCI receptacle only has one pair of wires getting electricity into it (line hot + line neutral). The other pair of wires (load hot + load neutral) are [for other pairs of non-GFCI receptacles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILBjnZq0n8s) somewhere some the load wires, so multiple outlets are protected by one GFCI.

- If you save only a portion of the password in your password manager, e.g. the `%7p3YTJ*n*y^tFzp` part of `%7p3YTJ*n*y^tFzp---Google`, this is called [peppering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography)), instead of salting. The pepper is the part of the password that not even your password manager knows. However, if you employ such a strategy, there is no longer convenience associated with a password manager auto-filling for you.

- `Enum` is a code smell when [you aren't *enumerating* over all of them](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/300101/116811). They should not be used as "if this then that" symbols. They should not be used in `switch` statements that don't handle all cases. But they are definitely a better chocice in these situations than, say, [constants that would have done the same work](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29306438).

- Mods can see deleted messages on Discord.
- On [salt-based vs salt-free water softeners](https://www.rwatersystems.com/5-water-softener-scams-to-be-aware-of): "While salt free systems are good at scale prevention that is pretty much all they are good for.

- `XMLHttpRequest` is called `XMLHttpRequest` because IE did it first. W3C recommends camel-casingt acronyms now, i.e. `XmlHttpRequest`, and [so does Microsoft](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15526526/1558430) (but only for acronyms more than two characters long, so `IO` is still `IO` for whatever reason).
- All five great lakes are connected. Ships go through them for trade. That's why the US-Canada border is like that.

An ideal door would have (e.g.) a flat nothing for you to pull on on one side, or a push bar with no handle for pulling. Unfortunately since every surface can be pushed on, there is no pull-only design.
- Lots of carpet stains can be removed by directly [applying dish soap](https://spotremoval.coit.com/how-to-remove-oil-stains-from-carpet) to it (and then dabbing it away).
- A house in the northern hemisphere that faces ("facing" is where most of your windows are) south is ideal, for the reasoning that [the sun never really shines into the house during the summer because of the angle of the sun, and the sun *does* shine into the house during the winter due to the angle, warming it up](https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/283818.html). If you have sun-lit windows all around the house, or walls that absorb heat, this advantage is less obvious.
- At [$130 of savings per year](https://nest.com/thermostats/real-savings/) on average, Nest thermostats typically pay themselves off in two years.

- Japanese choose not to have children [once every 60 years](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/curse-fire-horse-how-superstition-impacted-fertility-rates-japan): [丙午](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinoe_uma), or 1966. The next time this happens is 2026, and the time after that, 2086.
- Google doesn't *sell* your data. Doing so would give advertisers one less reason to buy ads from Google. So yes, Google knows everything about you, but also yes, it has at least one incentive to keep it secure.
- Thermo-electric coolers (TECs) are [not good enough at drawing heat from a CPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWrqyQWfhrs), so they are not popular, though if your CPU is sufficently low in wattage, [companies do sell coolers for them](https://global.blackshark.com/products/black-shark-funcooler-2pro).

- [Land in Japan has real value](https://housekey.jp/does-japanese-real-estate-decrease-value-go-down/). [The house built on the land does not](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/nov/16/japan-reusable-housing-revolution). Apparently the build quality after WWII is so bad that it makes no sense to maintain them, and to keep up with modern standards like earthquake resilience.
- In the American version of the alphabet song, V rhymes with Z. In the British version of the alphabet song, T does not rhyme with Z.
- "Linked" houses share a foundation. They do not appear linked above ground. Any linkage above ground results in a townhouse setup.
- Europe and Japan have inter-generational mortgages. They can go for 60 to [100 years](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/1061951895900047). This is how they promote home "ownership", while being basically rent.

- A "skinny bitch" is vodka, soda water, and lime juice.
- In [`a = c++`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16869073/1558430), `a` is assigned the value of `c` before it is incremented. You can remember this as "C++ will be C".
- [Hump day](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hump%20day) is Wednesday.
- To avoid getting ingrown toenails, cut them when they are dry (supposedly wet nails rip instead of cut, which is worse, but I don't know enough to say whether it is true.)
- There is a piece called [4'33"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh-o3udImy8), which is the length of time of silence in the piece. No one plays anything.
- You can kick the ball in volleyball.
- Prefixing nonstandard headers with an `X-` was [deprecated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields) in 2012 because those headers eventually become standard, but the `X-` is never removed.
- A [negative cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_cache) caches even failures. It is used when computation is very expensive, where failures would otherwise lead to indefinite, expensive retries.
- The Snapdragon 801 chipset was used in [both the OnePlus One and the Ingenuity helicopter in Mars](https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/19/the-cpu-inside-the-oneplus-one-takes-flight-on-mars/). Or the OG Pixel I guess. This made the helicopter [many orders of magnitude](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/aerospace/robotic-exploration/nasa-designed-perseverance-helicopter-rover-fly-autonomously-mars) higher in processing power than that on the rover that carried it.
- "A roll" is really footage from the primary camera, and "B roll" is really footage from the secondary camera. B roll is allowed to be more creative, or in some ways, worse.

- What is the Japanese food [ebimayo](http://www.dailyunadventuresincooking.com/recipe/ebi-mayo-recipe-japanese-fried-shrimp/)? Don't overthink it. It is literally ebi (shrimp) + mayo (mayonnaise).
- [GraphQL is strongly-typed](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html). This means a few things: you need to define those types; you typically need to [*statically*](https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/quickstart/#creating-a-basic-schema) define those types; there is [no `Any` type](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46402182/graphene-graphql-dictionary-as-a-type); it is a lot of repetitive work if you have already defined [similar interfaces](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/).
- Gold foil [keeps spacecraft warm](https://www.sciencefocus.com/space/what-is-the-function-of-the-golden-foil-that-covers-space-probes/), or cool, depending on where the sun is.
- Generating an archive file (zip, tar.gz, tar.xz, 7z, whatever else) by reversing the file names first happens to [sort files by file type](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26459184), which occasionally allows the archive to be compressed more efficiently. ["Note that sorting by type has some drawbacks." (...) NTFS volumes on hard drives will extract/compress the archive slower due to the sorted-by-name nature of the filesystem](https://www.7-zip.org/faq.html). To enable the former behaviour anyway, use `-mqs`.
- A [livelock](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-starvation-and-livelock/) is like a deadlock, except the two threads are constantly locking and unlocking two or more alternate resources, achieving nothing. An example would be [two people moving out of the way to let the other pass, just to be blocked again](https://www.guru99.com/what-is-livelock-example.html). In contrast, a deadlock is just a car breaking down on a one-lane highway.
- Impact drivers [can](https://www.deborahcopakenkogan.com/can-you-drill-with-an-impact-driver/) be used as a drill. So maybe we can think of impact drivers as better drills.
- There is no way a server can tell a client has aborted an HTTP request [until the server tries to send the client something](https://serverfault.com/questions/147886/what-happens-when-a-http-request-is-terminated-prematurely).
- HTTP headers: [`no-cache` means the resource is explicitly cacheable](https://httptoolkit.tech/blog/http-wtf/), and the browser will definitely cache it, but should always ask the server if the resource is up to date. If you want "no caching" no cache, use `no-store` instead.
- Statistically, [motorcycles are 35x more dangerous than cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#Statistics), while cars are themselves 7x more dangerous than buses.
- The US calls [the trade deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States%E2%80%93Mexico%E2%80%93Canada_Agreement) "USMCA". Canada calls it "CUSMA". Mexico calls it "Tratado entre México, Estados Unidos y Canadá". In every country, their own name comes first. They signed the deal in Argentina.
- [Alimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alimony) is given to the spouse, whether or not the recipient has children. That's child support. Neither has a set length or amount. Lawyers use a special calculator to make stuff up.
- Unit testing is [a kind of functional testing](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/functional-testing).
- In Italy, [vermicelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermicelli) is thicker than spaghetti. Vermicellini, or thin vermicelli, is also thinner than the American vermicelli.

- "If you force users to trade convenience for security, they will find a way to obtain convenience at the expense of security." - Passed around legend at this point
- [Deism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism) is rejecting religious texts as a basis of the existence of a god, but rather through reason and observation of the natural world, i.e. "I believe there's a god but that book is bullshit". Thomas Jefferson believes in one of these.
- "踩坑" means trying and failing, and repeating the process until you succeed.
- Use silicone caulking where waterproofing is needed, and acrylic caulking everywhere else. Silicone is hard to work with, so use it only where waterproofing is necessary. Acrylic caulking won't just dissolve away either... it takes quite some time once dried.
- In a microservice architecture, a service can cache results from another service, *and* other services can read from that (e.g. asking the payment service for the user's information, rather than going directly to the users service)... as long as we understand that the result is [**read-only** and **non-authoritative**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOZFmFNl1uk). You cannot update the user from the payment system, and you cannot trust what the payment system tells you.
- The American ["top sirloin"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirloin_steak) is positioned under "sirloin", while what the Brits call "sirloin" is more the back ribs than loin, and preferring to call American sirloin parts the "rump".
- Every odd number has an 'e' in it. [Except 1, 2, 8, 30, and 50](https://legendary-archive.tumblr.com/post/189857810354/hey-there-princey-nerdy-as-heck-m-pennanti)... these odd numbers don't have an 'e' in it. At least not on tumblr.com, they don't.
- An [eromenos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eromenos) is a the sub in a dom-sub relationship between two gay men.

- [Some KN95 masks have neck and head straps, but most have just ear loops](https://jayparkmd.medium.com/how-to-spot-a-fake-kn95-mask-from-china-d5219e7f0ab2). The ones with neck and straps form a tight enough seal to be medical grade. That is the major difference between N95 and KN95 other than shape and certification.
- A Christmas tree can be *any* tree, as long as it is decorated. It doesn't even need to be a real tree.

- From the router's perspective, RX means uploading because it is technically receiving data from you, the client, and TX means downloading because it is technically transferring data to you.
- [Zero-day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_%28computing%29) originally referred to exploits found during the 0th day of the software's release. Now the scope is broader than that; it applies to bugs that the vendor knows about for 0 days, but could have been shipped a long time ago, as well as bugs that the vendor knew about for a long time (with the first day being day 0), but never fixed.
- [Baffled tanks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFAywqwGjUc) are near impossible to clean, so they aren't used to carry milk.

- The 2.4GHz spectrum is 100MHz wide. The 5GHz spectrum is 1GHz wide, allowing for much more non-overlapping channels.
- Because music [note frequencies go up by the square root of 2 every octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_equal_temperament), and there are 12 notes every octave (including "black keys"), every note goes up by (the 12th root of 2)%, or around 6%.
- John and Jonathan do not share a word root. The most we can say they share is the "J-", which was [YHWH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton) (i.e. God) in Hebrew.
- QWERTY layout is (somewhat coincidentally) good for smartphone typing because it spaces commonly-used keys far apart from each other.
- Keyboard keys are staggered only because [typewriters had tiny bars going in between the keys](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/40390/why-are-keyboard-keys-staggered), and it wouldn't have worked if the keys were ortholinear. We don't have these bars on computer keyboards today, obviously.
- Since 4K is exactly 4x as many pixels as 1080p, 1080p is also known as 1K, and 4K is also known as 4320p. *Maths*.

- The ["test" and "reset" buttons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILBjnZq0n8s) next to power sockets are ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs). ~~They are fitted if within a certain distance from a water source~~ (haha never mind Canada doesn't do that). They detect current that doesn't return, which indicates current leaking through (the body). When a current leakage occurs, a solenoid + plunger inside kicks the button and kills the circuit, which you can reset with, well, "reset".
- Tea is the most consumed drink in the world (after water). This means people like putting plants in water. Caffeine is around 3% of tea's dry weight... which is [about the same as ground coffee, actually](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/coffee-instant).

- On Google pushing URL-less browsers and AMP to make the company the web itself: "I'm not a Richard Stallman type, but I think it's come to the point where if you have even the slightest pretense of being a "free web" person, using Chrome or a Chromium-based browser has become unconscionable." - [dmitryminkovsky, 2020](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24158682)
- A [wire service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_agency) like "AP" and "Reuters" gathers news, and then sells them to other newspaper companies to reprint them. Apparently having a middle man works for them. "To achieve such wide acceptability, the agencies avoid overt partiality. Demonstrably correct information is their stock in trade. ... They avoid making judgments and steer clear of doubt and ambiguity." - [Jonathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Fenby)

[It also suffers from a ~50% power loss](https://onezero.medium.com/wireless-charging-is-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen-48afdde70ed9?gi=sd) more than cabled, which itself suffers from power loss.

- The [CAP Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) (consistency, availability, partition tolerance) theorem says that it is impossible for a distributed data store to do all three of those things.
- A ["three months rule" for engagement rings](https://www.theknot.com/content/spending-three-months-salary-on-engagement-ring) is bullshit. It used to be one month in the 1930s, and two months in 1980s. Even without Da Beers telling you what to do, think about what it means: it just tells other people *when* you got married (when you were young and broke vs old and rich). It doesn't reflect at all how much someone loves the wearer.
- A full stop at the end of a url is [completely valid](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/07/whose-bug-is-it-anyway/), but that fact also makes them useless if someone ends a sentence with a url.
- According to [a hacker news post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23917131), team velocity varies wildly among FAANG companies.
- The official slack blog says that threaded conversations are meant for ["conversations that may not be relevant to everyone"](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/bringing-your-bot-into-threaded-messages-cd272a42924f). Therefore, if you are talking to someone directly, it is senseless to use threads.
- Some consider a sandwich still a sandwich even as the two halves are split: [open sandwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_sandwich).
- Some consider a sandwich still a sandwich when it has no bread at all: [breadless subs](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/breadless-cucumber-tuna-salad-sandwiches-3363120).
- A UUID encoded as base64 instead of hexadecimal like [`cdaed56d-8712-414d-b346-01905d0026fe`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/772802/storing-uuid-as-base64-string) is still `za7VbYcSQU2zRgGQXQAm/g==`, i.e. not as short as you think.
- [DDR-5 added on-die ECC](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15912/ddr5-specification-released-setting-the-stage-for-ddr56400-and-beyond) only because the random error rate is so high, they *had* to.
- [SHA-2 is an algorithm](https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/). SHA-256 is an implementation of SHA-2, with an output size of 256 bits.
- When your architecture is such that the user logs in from one server and does stuff with another server, you cannot use session auth, so (some kind of) token auth is your best bet.
- Plaster is more soundproof, but less thermally insulating. Plaster is also more expensive, and harder to repair, so you rarely see it used anymore.
- The majority of meteors light up for [less than a second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-__IX144HDg), it appears.
- Wood (like 2x4) containing the core of the tree tends to warp much more easily.

- "Millenials" are also called [Gen Y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z#/media/File:Generation_timeline.svg). The ones born between 2010 and 2025 are called "Gen Alphas".
- All of the [top ten most powerful woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_list_of_The_World%27s_100_Most_Powerful_Women) are from USA or the EU. Also, there are no powerful poor people.
- [Hadoop stores data in a compressed, schemaless format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfF750YVDxM). In hadoop, the database doesn't decide how to run your queries... the Java code does. The code finds optimal servers to serve each request. On one hand, storing tons of copies of data is a waste of space. On the other hand, reads (especially considering hadoop offers only eventual consistency) are really fast.
- A columnar database has a [slight read advantage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KGVFB3kVHQ) if you know exactly the subset of columns you need to read. Theory is columnar databases don't need to read the entire row into memory, which may not be true for modern databases in practice.
- Comments in a `.po` file [can](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Fuzzy-Entries.html) have [effects](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15653093/what-does-fuzzy-mean-at-the-top-of-a-xgettext-generated-pot-file). They are called "special system comments", or in other languages, annotations.
- Usually, when people die, they stay on the same planet. So they are always with you.
- According to the book "Designing Data-Intensive Applications", Twitter fans out (creates for each follower) tweets, so anyone who follows you doesn't need to do a join to see your tweets... except for people with lots of followers, because a tweet from one of these people would mean having to write the same tweet millions of times.
- It is not simply true that a database should not be used as a messaged queue. Redis (database used as queues) and Kafka (queue system with DB-like guarantees) are such data systems that blur the lines.
- A videos says [Amazon want to be a monopsony, not a monopoly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPGZgujnVek): a situation where there is only one buyer. It wants to be the only buyer [of goods] in town, making them the only one to sell goods...? This is much less "evil" under the public eye.
- [Jeff Hammerbacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hammerbacher) was quoted saying "The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks." His LinkedIn says he went to Harvard.
- An [`HttpOnly` cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) is only sent to the server; it is not accessible through code.
- Ask about the expected scale of your feature. [If you don't ask, you need to assume you design for the main product scale](https://dropbox.tech/application/engineering-dropbox-transfer--making-simple-even-simpler), which can be a billion concurrent users (Google search).
- Twits (which I assume is the term for people who use Twitter... that, or Twats) combat the length limit by replying to themselves, effectively starting a thread.
- [CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/) is Perl's version of NPM. Since [the language is stuck in the 2010s](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23633478), and even the site itself is stuck in 2017, there is no need to learn it.
- An timeline full of horizontal bars is called a [gantt chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart), invented by Henry Gantt.
- The Japanese name for a prostitute's working area is called a [teahouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_hotel) (茶屋).
- Perl---and [TIMTOWTDI](http://wordaligned.org/articles/timtowtdi-vs-tsboapooowtdi)--epitomises the big picture. It is important to get something to work, any way you can, not because you have a passion for programming *the best shit*, but because you have other more important *shit* to do. You just want to get shit done and go home. See the big picture.
- "Vishing"... Voice phishing... is calling into a call centre and social engineering them.
- When you were young and naive (i.e. a few minutes ago) you thought [they hand-shaped every piece of nigiri sushi](https://ozawa.ca/product/autec-nigiri-sushi-maker/). There's [a tool for everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH_RURy525w) man.
- Almost all bitter drinks are supposed to be [served with ice](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-moscow-mule-sucks-15_b_4919024) so the dilution improves the taste with each sip. Also, negroni is either the most overrated or underrated cocktail, depending on which list you look at, and [how you decide to mix the stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/9ugfa8/the_most_overrated_cocktails_according_to/e947ekf/).
- In JSON Schema, [number](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/numeric.html) is only integers and floating point, not "infinity" or "NaN". Reason: [JSON cannot contain Infinity or NaN](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61844072/1558430) anyway.

- The [negroni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negroni) cocktail is served [strictly before a meal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ap%C3%A9ritif_and_digestif).
- There is no benefit shooting [23.976fps vs 24fps](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/8m6z54/24p_vs_23976p/). 23.976 happened when the NTSC colour system wanted colour TV to be played at 29.97fps rather than 30fps for black and white.
- [On line breaks (for anything in a terminal)](https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/5/29/1038), Linus said "Excessive line breaks are BAD" ... and he does "not care about somebody with a 80x25 terminal window
getting line wrapping". ... "80-column terminals in 2020 isn't reasonable any more as far as (he was) concerned". Yet, here was the same guy [arguing for wrapping at 72 columns in git / github commit messages](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5660417), so maybe 80-column lines in C is annoying to read when [8-space indentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html) is used. See also: [other people arguing for 80, 100, 120-column lines](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/gt4wgn/linus_torvalds_on_80character_line_limit/).
- [Tegestology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink_coaster) is collecting drink coasters.
- [Tree spiking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_spiking). When you hate tree loggers so much, you plant metal rods inside a tree when they are young, so they fuck with logging companies decades into the future.
- Mercenaries are soldiers who fight for money (rather than honour or political interests).
- [A stay-at-home mom works 24/7](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2015/05/22/a-stay-at-home-moms-duties-need-to-be-shared/) and needs her work shared with her spouse, who... presumably doesn't do anything at home then, in order for this argument to be made.
- A defector says [North Koreans are actually very happy and laugh a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyqUw0WYwoc). When you have too much, you think too much. In the same video: for some reason they can't afford rice ($3 per kg), but can illegally access outside information via CDs and USB drives, so they can afford computers. They even have phones! But if you call South Korea, you die. They defect now not because they don't can't survive, but because there is no freedom, and they have dreams that they cannot fulfil.
- The [President of Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Singapore#Election) is [directly elected by the people](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/the-government), [since 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_elections_in_Singapore)... but [the 2017 presidental election had only one candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Singaporean_presidential_election), and she won uncontested. The [Prime Minister of Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) is appointed by the president rather than through election, and although acts as effective head of the Executive branch, does not control the Judiciary and Legislative branches.

- **Redis can be slower than your database** if you use it to `SCAN` through its cache `KEYS`. Because it's an idiot and (presumably) stores keys in like an array instead of a hash table. If you use redis that way, **caching something will be slower than not caching at all**.
- [Casu marzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casu_marzu), or rotten fly maggot cheese from Sardinia, is/was illegal to sell. "The acid from the maggots' digestive system breaks down the cheese's fats, making the texture of the cheese very soft." While maggots are traditionally eaten with the cheese, some prefer not to eat it anymore.

- A grifter uses confidence to engage in small-scale swindling (monetary fraud).
- "Hotel" came first. "Motel" came after.
- ISO 8601 can be used to denote durations, with a string starting with `P`. `P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S` is a period of 3 years, 6 months, ... where each component can be left out if it is 0. Note that there are *two* `M`s, which is fine, because there is a `T` in between day and time durations, so "a month" is `P1M`, and "a minute" is `PT1M`.
- The ISO 8601 duration format allows you to specify more than 24 hours in the `H` component because "a day", i.e. `P1D`, is not the same as "24 hours", i.e. `PT24H`, during daylight savings.

- People have historically been arrested for celebrating ["straight pride"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pride).

The flag drew further protests." So there _are_ things that only minorities can do.

- On writing zeroes to your SSD (instead of `TRIM`) to gain performance: ["although performance may have been regained ... The default state of an empty page is all ones, not zeroes, and how could a piece of software possibly erase NAND flash?. The real reason was that ... the invalid pages were then candidates for garbage collection, which gave a much greater pool of blocks to call upon on writes, and hence a better performance.

[René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes) was debunking philosophical axioms in the 1600s ("a statement that is so evident or well-established, that it is accepted without controversy or question"), where people believe something exists it can be seen or heard.

Just hone the knife once every few meals, and sharpen your knife with any sharpener---not necessarily whetstones---as long as you are willing to try.
- The [Brubacher Edge Sharpness Scale](https://hubpages.com/education/So-Whats-the-BESS-Brubacher-Edge-Sharpness-Scale) (BESS) [numerically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcFvarfMKM) assesses how sharp your knife is. It is related to pressure (i.e. area of the edge). To test it, you cut a strand of filament on top of a scale. The amount of force (but in grams) you can exert on the filament before it breaks (i.e. the BESS) is larger for dull knives, and smaller for sharp knives.
- [Bookkeepers work under accountants](https://www.skillsacademy.co.za/senior-bookkeeper/), and, in general, the finance department. *Senior* bookkeepers can also work on payroll. Accountants [plan out what bookkeepers will record](http://www.stasuik.com/what-is-the-difference-between-an-accountant-and-a-bookkeeper/), as well as manage the process used to monitor business activities.

- When it comes to sealing letters, [the type of wax you use makes a difference](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/cx7e1l/guide_to_sealing_wax_etiquette/). Red seals mean formal business (the usual kind), black wax is for death and other types of mourning, green is for casual stuff, pink is for congratulations, white is for wedding invitations, and blue means romance and passion. Sealing wax is not wax. [It is shellac](https://youtu.be/xxb-XqsgaqM).
- Turns out you can never ask others [how to be a good wife/mother/daughter in law](https://www.zhihu.com/question/343092533). It's not possible to get a straight answer, even if you were a woman. Everyone says you are holding yourself hostage ("道德绑架", moral coercion). No one will tell you how to be a good anything. You just have to guess. Anyway, the answer to being a good husband (because for some reason *that's* okay to share) is: "有钱，足以养活老婆一家的，让他们全在家歇着，你一个人养活他们，家务全包，孩子自己带，还不说一句怨言。女人都想要这样的。"

- On ["token auth" vs "JWT token auth"](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40495728/1558430), it just seems to be that JWT tokens have automatic expiry dates (because their abilities are self-contained). This causes JWT auths to end up having session-like characteristics.
- JWTs are typically [also quite large](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/08/17/why-jwts-suck-as-session-tokens) due to the same fact that their information is self-contained.
- If a HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header is sent to your client, it will refuse to re-connect to your server with insecure (i.e. HTTP) connections for however many seconds you specify. [HSTS will only apply to the subdomain that applied it](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/112564), as well as the domains that are subdomain to it, but not its parents.
- Sending a `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` header [magically](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/middleware/#x-xss-protection-1-mode-block) stops a page from loading if the client finds the same contents on the page.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) has its own RFC, 7519. Each JWT is a three-part URL-safe string, in the form `(header).(payload).(signature)`. You send this thing in the `Authorization` header, like: `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGci...<snip>...yu5CSpyHI`. The point of JWT is that [it is stateless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token), so if your thing uses sessions, don't use JWT.
- JWT is [mostly](https://jwt.io/introduction/) for the server to verify that the user is who they say they are. Anyone can make a request to the server. But if the server generates a public key for a specific user, then only that particular user, who received the public key, can authenticate again as that user.
- Wikipedia seems to imply that Hong Kong's water is [bought](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E4%BE%9B%E6%B0%B4) from China; [a video on Weibo](https://m.weibo.cn/status/4408978802721694) seems to imply that the water is provided for free (because he mentioned that the construction is 100% paid for by China and suggests the water is also a gift). Water's price [doubled between 2007 and 2016](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E4%BE%9B%E6%B0%B4#%E5%83%B9%E6%A0%BC%E7%88%AD%E8%AD%B0), so while free construction is a nice gesture, the water is definitely not free.
- Did you know that [Lee Kuan Yew, old style boi, spoke better English than most Singaporeans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJH0djHK6xU) today? Or even [his son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6lJFpsika0)?
- An [uxoricide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uxoricide) is when you kill your wife. *Uxor* is wife in Latin. Killing your husband is [matricide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariticide). Killing your *maternal* uncle is [Avunculicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avunculicide). There is no specific word for killing one's paternal uncle, one's aunt, coworkers, or mother in law.

Other [da vinci-esque interpretations](https://twitter.com/gracehw/status/1162222858757529603) indicate he wanted China to let Hong Kong rule itself. "The [background of the poem] is the [queen] killed her sons one after another. Who [else] on earth once claimed herself [to be] a loving mother?"
- Unsanitised window navigation calls (like `?next=foo`) can be exploited to make the user run arbitrary JavaScript. If the code says `window.location.href = foo`, and `foo` is `javascript: alert()`, you just dun goof'd. That `foo` can be something much worse.
- According to "lost all hope", whose author tried to end himself and lived to tell everyone to think twice, [tighter emission controls today means it is no longer practical to kill yourself with a running car in the garage today](http://lostallhope.com/suicide-methods/carbon-monoxide-co-poisoning). By [lethality](http://lostallhope.com/suicide-methods/statistics-most-lethal-methods), shotgun to the head kills 99% of the time, overdosing on illegal drugs kills only half of the time but is the most painless, while jumping from a tall place is the only "no tools required" method that still has a 90%+ kill rate (if you count a train as a tool).

- If "Tangam Systems" was named Tangam because that's the founder's grandmother's name, then it is structurally no different from "Bob Gaming", ["John's No Frills"](https://goo.gl/maps/kSAvpz6X11eQbE2J9), or "Grandmasoft".
- Medium is good because [the import tool is good, and it helps other people discover your posts](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/14/medium-publishing).

- The longest-serving public servant in Hong Kong is [Mr Matthew Cheung](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BC%B5%E5%BB%BA%E5%AE%97), now (1972~2019~) the Chief Secretary for Administration, which is the most senior you can become without [being appointed by mainland China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_of_Hong_Kong).
- VLC's "compressor", actually [dynamic range compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression), works by reducing the max volume and min volume of some audio, reducing its dynamic range. Since "louder music sounds better", the availability of dynamic range compressors led to [loudness war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war), where everyone uses automatic dynamic range compression without clipping.
- Bankruptcy is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. [There are consequences](https://www.hoyes.com/blog/5-reasons-not-to-file-bankruptcy/). First of all, all your assets [except stuff like clothes and tools](https://www.hoyes.com/personal-bankruptcy/effects-of-claiming-bankruptcy/) must be sold to clear your existing debts. Second, if you earn more than what you should for 9~36 months after bankruptcy, that income goes to pay the debt. Third, this stays on your credit file for 14 years.
- The Trots. An obscure term for diarrhea. The runs also works, but it is more well-known. Even more obscure: "News of a slightly inconvenient nature... they have arrived."
- You can cook hard boiled eggs in an instant pot?
- For the most part, Trent Reznor is the only permanent member in [Nine Inch Nails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails). (Atticus Ross joined in 2016.) He is a singer, producer, and instrumentalist; he writes and plays his own songs.
- If you lost your cat [and it isn't dead yet], put the litterbox outside to let it smell its way home [whenever it feels like it].
- ["Growing pains"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_pains) are not pains that are growing; growing pains are pains you get when you were a child; when you were *growing*. Biologically-speaking, the pains have nothing to do with growing.
- There's (apparently you learned this before) a [memory wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory#Memory_wall), or the disparity between CPU speed (very fast), and the memory outside the CPU (not so fast).
- If your house is infested by bedbugs, it may be worthwhile to surround your new bed with boric acid for a month or two (which is cheap to try) before you look for an exterminator.
- The [gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard) is where the value of a currency is based on a fixed amount of gold. It is not recommended, because [during times of recessions and depressions, people will tend to hold onto gold instead of currency. Since they're not spending it into the economy, it somewhat prolongs recessions/depressions](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/cmbgis/eli5_what_does_it_mean_when_a_country_like_china/ew1ol1x/).

- Twins can be born days apart. [In Ireland, one twin was prematurely born, but the other was not](https://sg.theasianparent.com/miracle-twins-born-87-days-apart), leading to a 87-day birthdate difference.
- A [flint cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_architecture) is a stone (flint) structure at the bottom of a corner of building, that discourages patrons (mostly men) from urinating there.
- Paying for a $720 phone as $30 * 24 months saves you around $30 in inflation. Getting a new subsidised phone every 2 years is better than not getting one at the end of your contract (because you're just losing out on your subsidy) but having no contract is the best option if available.
- [The government wants to know your spotify data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHHbqEhU0gc) because there is a correlation between the economic climate (actually, your sentiment of it), and the kinds of songs you listen to. During an economic downturn, people enjoy songs with anger, digust, fear, sadness, and anticipation. Inversely, if you know people enjoy happy and dancing songs, *then the stock markets go up*.

The major selling point is the client defines the structure of the data that the server returns, so it always gets what it wants. The major disadvantage is, well, if the client can make calls like that, then the server can't cache these results efficiently.
- On using assertions on production: ["(A good) approach is to leave the assertions in the code when you ship, and to automatically file a bug report on behalf of the end user and perhaps to try to re-start the application every time an assertion fails. At that same startup I mentioned above I had a boss who insisted that we not do this. I pointed out to him that an assertion failure meant that something in the program was very wrong and that it was likely that the program would produce the wrong result. ... *He said it was more important that the company avoid the appearance of having done something wrong than that we stop before producing an incorrect result.* I left the company."](https://rbcs-us.com/documents/Why-Most-Unit-Testing-is-Waste.pdf) Takeaway: write assertions when assertions will do, and unit tests when assertions will not.
- Build your software with three kinds of user interfaces. One, with the fewest buttons, to end users. Another one, with all buttons, for you (the developer). Finally, the one for operations and administrators that aren't you: NSA, the Russian government, whatever, to make sure they can do their jobs.
- "[If you want to reduce your test mass, the number one thing you should do is look at the tests that have never failed in a year (and the code hasn't been touched in the same year) and consider throwing them away.](https://rbcs-us.com/documents/Why-Most-Unit-Testing-is-Waste.pdf) They are producing no information for you — or at least very little information. The value of the information they produce may not be worth the expense of maintaining and running the tests. This is the first set of tests to throw away — whether they are unit tests, integration tests, or system tests."

- The 及第 in [及第粥](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E5%8F%8A%E7%AC%AC%E7%B2%A5) came from 雜底 rather than [進士及第](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%BF%9B%E5%A3%AB%E5%8F%8A%E7%AC%AC). 進士 meant you're among the top 3 *classes* (一、二、三甲) in the central government entrance exam, 及第 meant you were selected, and 進士及第 meant you were one of the three people *among* 一甲 who was selected. As an aside, 進士出身 means you were in 二甲, 同進士出身 means you were in 三甲, and the name of the congee has almost nothing to do with the examination system.

- Submarines can't use GPS... submarines use sonar. But sonar tells enemies their location. So they just guess with inertia. Submarines also can't get internet... so they use VLF radio instead, where they can receive limited information at 700 words per minute.
- [Half of all large ships are registered in panama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7CvEt51fz4), because taxation is so low. An international ship follows the laws of its country, as long as it is outside any other country's territorial waters (12 miles from the coast).
- A [philosophical razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor) is called that because it "shaves off" unlikely explanations for something.

Formatting is not everything. [Just because a rule exists, it doesn't mean it makes sense to obey it.](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/small-functions-considered-harmful-91035d316c29): "Programmers who insist on (doing pretty much anything minor) risk not seeing the forest for the trees."
- The fabulous Rubyist Sandi Metz has a famous talk called All The Little Things, where she posits that ["duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction", and thus to "prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE).

- [HTTP has 30+ registered method names](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods/http-methods.xhtml), most of which being WebDAV exclusives. When I say "WebDAV exclusive", it means [the `REPORT` method](https://evertpot.com/dropbox-post-api/) is [an extension of WebDAV RFC2518, and therefore an extension of HTTP 1.1 RFC2616, but not actually part of HTTP 1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253#section-1.1).

- Interest in [Hudson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_%28software%29), Jenkins' predecessor, collapsed because Oracle wanted to trademark "Hudson". [Other reasons to hate Oracle](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/2e2c1o/what_do_we_hate_oracle_for/cjvewbi/): Buying Java with the sole purpose to sue Google for money, burning MySQL so people move to Oracle DB, only allowing fortune 500 companies to contribute to OpenOffice, closing source for Solaris so OpenSolaris can no longer be built.
- You are supposed to test _just_ the function in a unit test, mocking everything except that function. Assuming [your language has no concept of interfaces](https://sendgrid.com/blog/when-writing-unit-tests-dont-use-mocks/), if you have a function call inside a function, and your unit test does not mock out anything, then you're doing something wrong.

- [Launching multiple brands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVHYcLV-H0A) lets a business target completely different audiences. In that example, Oppo made the Oneplus brand because one sells expensive phones to idiots offline, while the other sells less expensive phones to a different group of idiots online.
- VPN scams include [stealing your data, showing you ads, stealing your bandwidth, offering "pro" packages that do nothing, logging when it says "no logging", literally doing nothing](https://restoreprivacy.com/vpn-scams/), and sometimes even routing through government servers.
- [Only racers near the back get blue shells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFfga8-3SZI). The blue shell is a homing missile that aims for the racer in the first place. It is therefore an equaliser (for casual players) that makes sure everyone is relatively close together. Its blast radius is designed to hit many players near the first racer. If you can't avoid the blue shell, the best thing you can do is to brake and hope the blast radius also hits the racer in second place.
- Companies want to [turn their brands into household names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_awareness), but not so much that it turns into the product category itself. See: [Nintendo calling their products "videogame consoles" to make sure "Nintendo" is not what they're making](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ah9wsh/til_nintendo_pushed_the_term_videogame_console_so/), and [Velcro calling their things "hook and loops"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRi8LptvFZY) so "Velcro" remains the name for the real deal.
- The [500 rule of astrophotography](https://petapixel.com/2015/01/06/avoid-star-trails-following-500-rule/) (i.e. taking photos of stars): if you keep your shutter open for too long, stars will start to trail and look bad. Use _500 Divided By the Focal Length of Your Lens (in mm) = The Longest Exposure (in Seconds) Before Stars Start to "Trail"_. If you have a 24mm lens, then 500/24 says you can only open your shutter for 20 seconds. Note: [focal length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length) is not the [focal point/distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_%28optics%29), which can be infinity.

- Alcantara is a microfibre material manufactured by a company called Alcantara.
- No one ever said proposals need to be a surprise. The moment you start asking for ring sizes, she would have already known something's up.
- [One-way plane tickets more expensive than return tickets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72hlr-E7KA0): flight companies want to price their trips as competitive as possible (assuming competition exists). So they make price brackets to lower some ticket prices, and raise some others to make up for the lower fares. They raise prices business travellers, who can pay more, to offset the cheaper tickets sold to holiday goers, who pay for their own tickets and are more budget-conscious. They use "price discrimination", aka pricing rules, to make sure "business-like" trips are charged more. Business trips don't have a "minimum stay" period, because business people travel for just a few days and return. When they do that, they also introduce a problematic case where they can't calculate how long your stay is when you book one-way... so it's just half the price of a business-like return trip, rather than the price of a holiday-like trip.
- When someone asks you "how much do we need to scale?", you need an answer based on two things you need to know: the number of additional users, and % extra load per user.
- The g in [gRPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC) stands for gRPC, because that's how **g**oogle names things.
- [ISO 8601 week dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates) are prefixed with a `W`, so `2018-W52` is the last week of the year. Note: these are ISO year and week numbers.
- ISO 8601 dates can come without the day: `2019-01`. This works because the ordinal date (year plus day number) must be three-digit padded, e.g. `2019-001`, and week numbers must be prefixed with a `W`, e.g. `2019-W01`.
- The Argentinian and Chilean governments sent pregnant women there to give birth in hopes that it'd would strengthen their claims to a piece of Antarctica.

- You're supposed to use a stack for checking whether a bunch of brackets match up with each other correctly. Alternatively, if you are skilled, prove that a `count('[') == count(']')` check is sufficient if the string starts with `[` and ends with `]`.
- Summing up [modern web development](https://www.sonniesedge.co.uk/talks/dear-developer): JS being required by default means it is overused, and used for the wrong things. "Yes, it's technically amazing to ... have your JS build a content page, but it's utterly over-engineered and impractical for most occasions (where HTML should be served as HTML)." Requiring JS to serve a page means the robustness goes missing, since users can disable JS. Also: developers make pages like everyone has unlimited fast Internet.

- [Commoditization](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/global-u-s-growth-in-smartphone-growth-starts-to-decline.html) is when a product becomes a commodity. When people have no brand loyalty towards a product, that product is a commodity.

- The ["ECB (electronic code book) mode"](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/225/should-i-use-ecb-or-cbc-encryption-mode-for-my-block-cipher) encrypts data block by block.

- If you buy a share of every stock out there in an exchange, you effectively track an index. If you buy a share from only the non-half-arsed stocks in an exchange, you effectively beat an index. If you go on and buy a share from only the stocks that consistently stay on or above average, which isn't hard to spot to be honest (say Apple or Adobe), then you easily beat an index. That is why index funds often outperform the indices that they track, but never by much.

- Israeli appliances often have this "[Sabbath mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath_mode)" thing that helps with living without doing work on Sundays.

So, lights and readings on stoves and fridges might turn off during the Sabbath, but not the actual ability to heat and cool food. Also made apparent is the [Sabbath lamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat_lamp), which bypasses the "doing work" criterion by simply having the light on before the Sabbath, and turning the lamp "on" or "off" with a shade that covers such a lamp, hence never actually operating the lamp itself.

Buffett got mad at the betrayal, bought the company (partially out of spite) and then cleaned house and made it his holding company. It's notable because that is one of the few times that Buffett bought on emotion versus numbers."
- Unlike Arkansas, the Arkansas City of Kansas is [pronounced](https://translate.google.com/#en/de/Arkansas%20City%2C%20KS%20in%20Arkansas%20and%20Kansas) ar-KAN-sas, with the S, like Kansas.

- You haven't really made microservices properly if [you need to change multiple microservices at once by many teams to make a feature](http://chi.pl/2017/01/30/Micro-monolith-Anti-pattern.html), or if you need to deploy multiple microservices at once to make it work, or if all these microservices, for some inexplicable reason, need the same framework to work together.

- The 13th character of a UUID4 string is always 4. All UUIDs have their 13th character set to their version.

- ["Senior developers are experts in their chosen technology stacks. They are given the hard tasks (the ones nobody knows how to solve) and often get design responsibilties. They often work independently because they have a proven track record of delivering the goods. They are expected to mentor Junior and intermediate developers. Often they are amazing troubleshooters. They have run into those same problems before and have a very good idea of where to look first. Seniors often mentor outside the workplace as well. They generally have at least ten years of experience and have almost always been on at least one death march and know exactly why some things are to be avoided. They know how to deliver a working product and meet a deadline. They know what corners can be cut and what corners should never be cut. They know at least one and often several languages at the expert level. They have seen a lot of "hot new technologies" hit the workplace and disappear, so they tend to be a bit more conservative about jumping on the bandwagon for the next exciting new development tool (but not completely resistant to change - those would be the older Intermediate developers who never make the leap to Senior). They understand their job is to deliver working software that does what the users want, not to play with fun tools. They are often pickier about where they will work because they can be and because they have seen first hand how bad some places can be. They seek out the places that have the most interesting tasks to do. Often they know more about their company's products than anyone else even if they have been there only a few months. They know they need more than programming knowledge and are good at getting knowledge about the business domain they support as well. They are often aware of issues that juniors never consider and intermediates often don't think about such as regulatory and legal issues in the business domain they support.
